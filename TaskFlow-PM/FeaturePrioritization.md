# TaskFlow Feature Prioritization

## Prioritization Methodology

Features were evaluated based on:
- **Impact (1-10)**: Value delivered to users and business
- **Effort (1-10)**: Development complexity and resource requirements
- **Priority Score**: Impact ÷ Effort (higher scores indicate better ROI)

## Decision Rationale

The TaskFlow feature prioritization strategy focuses on delivering core value quickly while setting a foundation for future capabilities:

1. **Task Management** and **Intelligent Dashboard** form the essential foundation, addressing the primary user pain points of fragmentation and visibility.

2. **Contextual Communication** ranks highest in ROI due to relatively lower effort with high impact, making it an ideal feature to differentiate the MVP.

3. **API Integrations** are prioritized in the MVP despite moderate effort because they are critical for adoption in existing workflows.

4. **Time Tracking** is positioned for Phase 2 despite high ROI because it's not essential to the core value proposition, but provides quick wins after establishing the foundation.

5. **Team Capacity Planning** is crucial for team leads but depends on core task management, making it ideal for Phase 2.

6. More complex features like **AI Task Prioritization** and **Mobile Application** are scheduled for Phase 3 when the platform has established user base and feedback.
